welcome to my github personal page!
here is a blog recording the reflection of my life, hopefully may have a positive effect on anyone.
life is hard , especially at the point of my age of time.
so many things you want , but so little you can do .
what you need is time , patience , dedicated heard and time to learn , think and grow.
talking is cheap , just do IT.
